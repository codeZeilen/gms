# gms: 'GAMS' Modularization Support Package

A collection of tools to create, use and maintain modularized model code
written in the modeling language 'GAMS' (<https://www.gams.com/>).
Out-of-the-box 'GAMS' does not come with support for modularized model
code. This package provides the tools necessary to convert a standard
'GAMS' model to a modularized one by introducing a modularized code
structure together with a naming convention which emulates local
environments. In addition, this package provides tools to monitor the
compliance of the model code with modular coding guidelines.
